<h3>What Is Mentoring?</h3>

Mentoring is a developmental relationship where a more experienced person shares wisdom, perspective, and guidance to support your professional and personal growth.

**Key Characteristics:**
- **Voluntary:** You choose to participate and can exit respectfully if needed
- **Developmental:** Focus is on your growth and learning
- **Longer-term:** Usually spans months or years, not weeks
- **Holistic:** Addresses career, skills, and personal development
- **Trust-based:** Built on confidentiality and mutual respect

<h3>What Mentoring Is NOT</h3>

Understanding boundaries helps set appropriate expectations:

**Not Managing:**
- Your mentor doesn't evaluate your performance
- They won't assign you work or provide resources
- They have influence through relationship, not authority

**Not Coaching:**
- Coaching is typically shorter-term and performance-focused
- Mentors share experience more freely than coaches
- The relationship is more personal and holistic

**Not Sponsorship:**
- Sponsors use organizational power to advocate for advancement
- Mentors focus on developing you, not positioning you
- (Though mentors may become sponsors over time)

**Not Therapy:**
- Mentoring addresses career and professional development
- Personal issues requiring mental health expertise need professional help
- Your mentor should refer you to appropriate resources when needed

<h3>What You Can Expect from Your Mentor</h3>

Your mentor will likely:
- Listen deeply and ask thoughtful questions
- Share relevant experiences and lessons learned
- Provide honest feedback on your blind spots
- Challenge you to think differently
- Connect you with resources and people
- Hold you accountable to your commitments
- Celebrate your successes and learn from setbacks
- Maintain confidentiality (with rare safety exceptions)

<h3>What Your Mentor Expects from You</h3>

To make this relationship successful, you should:
- Come prepared to each meeting
- Be open and honest about your challenges
- Take ownership of your development
- Follow through on commitments
- Be receptive to feedback
- Invest time in reflection and action
- Communicate proactively about scheduling or issues
- Respect agreed-upon boundaries

> Remember: You own your development. Your mentor is a guide and support, but you're responsible for your growth.

<h2 id="challenges"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">Navigating Challenges</h2>

<h3>When You're Not Following Through</h3>

If you consistently don't act on commitments:

**Ask Yourself:**
- Are these really my goals or someone else's?
- Am I overcommitting in the moment?
- What's actually getting in my way?
- Do I need different kinds of actions?
- Am I afraid of something?

**Talk to Your Mentor:**
"I notice I keep not following through on my commitments. Can we talk about what's really going on?"

<h3>When Feedback Is Hard to Hear</h3>

If feedback triggers defensiveness:

**Pause:**
- Take a breath before responding
- Notice your reaction
- Remember feedback is data, not truth

**Seek to Understand:**
- Ask clarifying questions
- "Can you give me an example?"
- "Help me understand what you observed"

**Take Time:**
- "I need to sit with this. Can we come back to it?"
- Process with others who know you
- Look for the grain of truth

**Respond:**
- Thank them for caring enough to share
- Identify what you'll do with the feedback
- Don't promise to change if you're not committed

<h3>When the Relationship Isn't Working</h3>

If something feels off:

**Name It:**
"Something feels different in our conversations. Can we talk about how our mentoring relationship is going?"

**Be Specific:**
- What's not working for you?
- What do you need that you're not getting?
- What could be better?

**Problem-Solve Together:**
- What adjustments would help?
- Should we change our format or frequency?
- Is this still the right fit?

**Know When to Exit:**
It's okay to end the relationship if:
- Needs have changed
- Better match exists elsewhere
- Time isn't right
- Chemistry isn't there

**How to Exit Gracefully:**
"I've been reflecting on our mentoring relationship, and I think I need [different expertise/more time/a break]. I'm grateful for what you've shared with me, and I think it's time for me to [move on/take a pause]. Would you be open to having a final conversation to reflect on what I've learned?"

<h3>When You Need More Than Mentoring</h3>

Some situations require professional help:

**Mental Health:**
If experiencing depression, anxiety, trauma, or other mental health concerns:
- Contact your Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
- Call 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline if in crisis
- Seek a licensed therapist

**Legal/Financial:**
For serious legal or financial problems:
- Consult appropriate professionals
- Mentoring isn't a substitute for expert advice

**HR Issues:**
For discrimination, harassment, or serious workplace issues:
- Contact your HR department
- Know your company's reporting procedures
- Document what's happening

> Your mentor may help you identify when you need additional support and connect you with resources.

Consider transitioning when:
- You've achieved your stated goals

- Create space for others' growth
- Build a culture of development

<h2 id="faq"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>How often should we meet?</h3>
Most mentoring relationships meet monthly for 45-60 minutes. Some meet more frequently early on, then space out. Discuss what works for both of you.

<h3>How long does mentoring last?</h3>
Typical relationships span 6 months to 2+ years. Many start with a defined period (e.g., 6 months) then decide whether to continue.

<h3>What if I need to cancel a meeting?</h3>
Give as much notice as possible. Propose alternative times. If you're canceling frequently, discuss with your mentor whether the timing is right.

<h3>Can I contact my mentor between meetings?</h3>
Depends on your agreement. Brief emails with quick questions are usually fine. Respect their boundaries and response times.

<h3>What if my mentor gives me advice I disagree with?</h3>
It's okay to disagree! Share your perspective. Remember: mentors share experience, but you make your own decisions. Take what's useful and leave the rest.

<h3>Should I tell my manager I have a mentor?</h3>
Usually yes, especially if the mentor is in your organization. Mentoring is development, not secrecy. But discuss with your mentor if there are special circumstances.

<h3>What if I'm not making progress?</h3>
Talk to your mentor about it. You might need different goals, different actions, more accountability, or a different approach. Or maybe you need additional support beyond mentoring.

<h3>How do I know if the relationship is working?</h3>
Signs it's working:
- You're learning and growing
- You look forward to meetings
- You're taking action on insights
- You feel challenged and supported
- Trust is building

Signs it's not:
- Conversations feel forced
- You're not implementing anything
- You dread meetings
- There's no chemistry
- You're not being honest

<h3>What if I want to end the relationship?</h3>
Be honest and respectful. Schedule a conversation to discuss. Thank them for their investment. Be clear about your reasons. Leave the door open for future connection.

<h3>Can we be friends?</h3>
Mentoring relationships often have friendship elements, but the primary purpose is developmental. Some evolve into friendship after the formal mentoring ends. Discuss boundaries with your mentor.
