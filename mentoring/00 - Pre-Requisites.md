Please spend 15-20 minutes reflecting on the following questions. Bring your notes to the workshop:

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Your Mentoring Experiences</b></p>

1. **Think about a mentor who made a positive impact on your life or career.**
   - What specific things did they do that helped you?
   - What qualities made them effective?
   - How did the relationship develop over time?

2. **Recall a time when you informally mentored someone (even briefly).**
   - What did you do to help them?
   - What went well? What was challenging?
   - What would you do differently now?

3. **Consider what you hope to gain from this workshop.**
   - What specific mentoring situations do you want to handle better?
   - What skills do you want to develop?
   - Who might you mentor after completing this workshop?

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Your Mentoring Philosophy (Draft)</b></p>

Begin thinking about your own mentoring philosophy by answering:
- What do you believe is the primary purpose of mentoring?
- What values do you want to bring to mentoring relationships?
- What boundaries or limitations do you need to set for yourself as a mentor?
- What would success look like in a mentoring relationship you facilitate?

*Note: You'll develop this further during the workshop, but starting this reflection now will deepen your learning.*

<h3>Mentoring vs. Other Developmental Relationships</h3>

Before the workshop, understand that mentoring is distinct from:
- **Coaching:** Usually shorter-term, performance-focused, often with external coaches
- **Managing:** Involves direct authority, performance evaluation, resource allocation
- **Sponsoring:** Uses organizational influence to create opportunities, often behind-the-scenes
- **Counseling/Therapy:** Addresses mental health, requires professional credentials

*You'll explore these distinctions in depth during Module 01.*
