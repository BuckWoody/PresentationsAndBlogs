<h2 id="01"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">1.1 What is Mentoring?</h2>

Mentoring is a developmental partnership through which one person shares knowledge, skills, information, and perspective to foster the personal and professional growth of someone else. At its core, mentoring is about:

- **Relationship:** A connection built on trust, respect, and mutual commitment
- **Development:** Focused on the mentee's growth and learning
- **Experience-sharing:** Drawing on the mentor's knowledge and insights
- **Long-term impact:** Creating sustainable change and growth

<h3>The Essence of Mentoring</h3>

Research from the Center for Creative Leadership and other organizations identifies these key characteristics of effective mentoring relationships:

**Voluntary Nature:** Both parties choose to participate and can exit respectfully<br>
**Developmental Focus:** Primary goal is the mentee's growth, not organizational metrics<br>
**Personal Connection:** Goes beyond professional topics to include values, identity, and life goals<br>
**Wisdom Sharing:** Mentor shares lived experience, not just technical knowledge<br>
**Trust-Based:** Built on confidentiality, honesty, and psychological safety<br>

> According to a 2019 study, 76% of professionals believe mentors are important, but only 37% currently have one. This workshop aims to increase the supply of qualified mentors.

<h3>What Mentoring Is NOT</h3>

To understand mentoring, it's equally important to understand what it is not:

**Not Managing:**
- Managers evaluate performance; mentors support development
- Managers assign work; mentors explore possibilities
- Managers have authority; mentors have influence through relationship

**Not Coaching:**
- Coaching is typically shorter-term and performance-focused
- Coaches ask questions to unlock mentee's own answers
- Mentors share experiences and advice more freely
- (Note: Good mentors use coaching techniques, but the relationships differ)

**Not Sponsoring:**
- Sponsors use organizational power to advocate for someone's advancement
- Sponsors open doors and create opportunities
- Mentors focus on developing the person, not their position

**Not Therapy or Counseling:**
- Mentors address career and professional development
- Mental health issues require licensed professionals
- Mentors should recognize when to refer to appropriate resources

- Label each as: Mentor, Manager, Coach, Sponsor, Peer, or Other

**Paired Discussion (8 minutes):**
- Share your diagram with a partner
- Discuss: What made each relationship valuable? How did they differ?
- Identify: Which relationships had the most impact on your career? Why?

**Large Group Debrief (7 minutes):**
- What patterns did you notice in the most impactful relationships?
- How did mentoring relationships differ from other types?
- What surprised you about this reflection?

<h2 id="02"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">1.2 Mentoring Models and Paradigms</h2>

There are several well-established models for mentoring relationships. Understanding these helps you choose the approach that best fits your context and your mentees' needs.

<h3>1.2.1 Traditional/Hierarchical Mentoring</h3>

The classic model where a more experienced person (mentor) guides a less experienced person (mentee).

**Characteristics:**
- One-to-one relationship
- Mentor typically more senior in career stage
- Focus on knowledge transfer and wisdom sharing
- Often long-term (1-3 years or more)
- May be informal/organic or formally structured

**Best for:**
- Career transitions and advancement
- Developing leadership capabilities
- Navigating organizational culture
- Long-term professional development

**Example:** A senior executive mentoring a manager who aspires to leadership

<h3>1.2.2 Peer Mentoring</h3>

Two individuals at similar career levels support each other's development.

**Characteristics:**
- Reciprocal learning relationship
- Equal power dynamic
- Focus on mutual problem-solving
- Often more frequent, shorter interactions

**Best for:**
- Developing new skills together
- Navigating similar challenges simultaneously
- Building accountability partnerships
- Cross-functional learning

**Example:** Two mid-level managers from different departments mentoring each other

<h3>1.2.3 Reverse Mentoring</h3>

A less experienced person (often younger) mentors someone more senior, typically on newer skills, technologies, or perspectives.

**Characteristics:**
- Junior person shares expertise with senior person
- Focus on specific knowledge gaps
- Challenges traditional hierarchies
- Often time-limited around specific topics

**Best for:**
- Technology and digital skills
- Understanding different generational perspectives
- Building inclusive leadership
- Staying current with emerging trends

**Example:** A recent graduate mentoring a senior leader on social media strategy

<h3>1.2.4 Group Mentoring</h3>

One mentor works with multiple mentees simultaneously in a group setting.

**Characteristics:**
- One-to-many structure
- Mentees also learn from each other
- More scalable than one-on-one
- Focus on common development themes

**Best for:**
- Onboarding cohorts
- Leadership development programs
- Building community and networks
- Efficient use of mentor's time

**Example:** A senior leader facilitating monthly discussions with 5-6 emerging leaders

<h3>1.2.5 Team or Flash Mentoring</h3>

Short, focused mentoring interactions often spanning a single conversation or brief period.

**Characteristics:**
- Time-limited (single meeting to few months)
- Focused on specific challenge or question
- Lower commitment threshold
- Can happen at networking events, conferences

**Best for:**
- Specific problems or decisions
- Getting multiple perspectives
- Building broader networks
- Entry point to longer-term mentoring

**Example:** A 30-minute coffee chat to discuss a career crossroads decision

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Matching Models to Scenarios</b></p>

In this exercise you will practice identifying which mentoring model best fits different situations.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Small Groups (10 minutes):**

You'll be given 5 scenario cards describing different mentoring needs. As a group:
1. Read each scenario
2. Determine which mentoring model(s) would be most appropriate
3. Discuss why that model fits the situation
4. Consider what alternative models might also work

**Scenarios:**

*Scenario 1:* A software engineer is struggling to understand the company culture and politics after joining from a very different organization. They need guidance over the next year as they establish themselves.

*Scenario 2:* A leadership team wants to better understand how younger employees view the company's technology choices and communication style.

*Scenario 3:* Five new managers were just promoted simultaneously and all face similar challenges learning to delegate, handle performance conversations, and build their teams.

*Scenario 4:* An individual contributor is considering whether to pursue a management track or continue deepening technical expertise. They need perspective on both paths.

*Scenario 5:* Two product managers from different business units want to improve their data analysis skills and could benefit from mutual support and accountability.

**Large Group Discussion (10 minutes):**
- Share your group's conclusions for each scenario
- Discuss where you disagreed and why
- What factors influence model selection?

<h2 id="04"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">1.4 Developing Your Mentoring Philosophy</h2>

Your mentoring philosophy is your personal framework for how and why you mentor. It reflects your values, beliefs, and commitments. While it will evolve with experience, articulating it now provides a foundation.

<h3>Components of a Mentoring Philosophy</h3>

A well-developed mentoring philosophy typically addresses:

**Purpose:**
- Why do you choose to mentor?
- What impact do you hope to have?
- What drives your commitment to others' development?

**Values:**
- What principles guide your mentoring?
- What matters most to you in these relationships?
- What won't you compromise on?

**Approach:**
- How do you believe people learn and grow?
- What's your style - directive, facilitative, somewhere between?
- How do you balance challenge and support?

**Boundaries:**
- What are you willing/able to provide?
- What's outside your scope?
- How will you maintain healthy limits?

**Expectations:**
- What do you expect from mentees?
- What can mentees expect from you?
- How will you measure success?

<h3>Sample Mentoring Philosophy Statements</h3>

Here are examples to inspire your own thinking:

**Example 1 - The Wisdom Sharer:**
> "I mentor because I've been fortunate to have guides who invested in me, and I want to pay that forward. I believe people grow fastest when they can learn from others' experiences without having to make every mistake themselves. My approach is to share candidly what I've learned - both successes and failures - and help mentees apply those lessons to their unique situations. I expect mentees to come prepared, be open to difficult feedback, and take action between our conversations. Success means they've developed greater confidence and capability to navigate their own career journey."

**Example 2 - The Facilitator:**
> "I mentor because I believe everyone has the answers inside them; they just need help accessing their own wisdom. My role is to ask powerful questions, hold up a mirror, and create space for mentees to discover their own path. I value curiosity, authenticity, and growth mindset above all. I'm here to facilitate their thinking, not provide answers. I expect mentees to do the hard work of self-reflection and be willing to try new behaviors. Success is when they no longer need me because they've built their own self-authoring capacity."

**Example 3 - The Connector:**
> "I mentor because expanding someone's network and possibilities is one of the most generous things we can do. I believe careers are built through relationships and opportunities, not just competence. My approach combines advice-giving with door-opening - I share what I know and connect mentees with others who can help. I expect mentees to be proactive in identifying what they need and to pay it forward by helping others as they advance. Success means they've built a robust network and seized opportunities they wouldn't have accessed alone."

<h3>Developing Your Philosophy</h3>

Your philosophy will be unique to you. Consider:

- Your own learning style and how that shapes your mentoring approach
- Cultural influences on your view of teaching and relationships
- Your personality (introverted vs extroverted, thinking vs feeling, etc.)
- Your career stage and what you have to offer
- Your capacity and constraints

> Your mentoring philosophy isn't static - it will evolve as you gain experience. The key is to have a starting point that feels authentic to you.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Drafting Your Mentoring Philosophy</b></p>

In this exercise you will create the first draft of your personal mentoring philosophy statement.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Individual Writing (12 minutes):**

Using the components framework, draft responses to:

1. **Purpose:** Why do I want to mentor? (2-3 sentences)
2. **Values:** What principles will guide my mentoring? (3-4 values or beliefs)
3. **Approach:** How do I believe people learn best? What's my style? (2-3 sentences)
4. **Boundaries:** What am I willing to provide? What's out of scope? (2-3 sentences)
5. **Expectations:** What do I expect from mentees? What can they expect from me? (2-3 sentences)

**Paired Sharing (8 minutes):**

Share your draft with a partner:
- Read your philosophy statement aloud
- Receive: What resonated? What questions arose?
- Refine: What might you add or clarify?

**Personal Commitment (2 minutes):**

Write one commitment to yourself:
"As I begin my mentoring journey, I commit to..."

> Save this philosophy draft - you'll revisit and refine it at the end of the workshop.
