<h2 id="01"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">3.1 The First Meeting: Setting the Foundation</h2>

The first meeting establishes the tone, expectations, and foundation for your entire mentoring relationship. Get it right, and you set both parties up for success.

<h3>Goals of the First Meeting</h3>

Your first conversation should accomplish several things:

**1. Build Connection**
- Get to know each other as people, not just roles
- Find common ground and shared values
- Begin building trust

**2. Align on Purpose**
- Understand why mentee sought mentoring
- Clarify what they hope to gain
- Ensure you're the right mentor for their needs

**3. Establish Working Agreement**
- Set expectations for how you'll work together
- Define boundaries and logistics
- Agree on measures of success

**4. Begin the Developmental Work**
- Start exploring their goals and challenges
- Demonstrate what mentoring will feel like
- Create early momentum

<h3>First Meeting Agenda Template</h3>

**1. Opening and Connection (15 minutes)**
- Share your stories: How did you get where you are?
- What brought you to this mentoring relationship?
- What are you curious about regarding each other?

**2. Purpose and Goals (15 minutes)**
- "What do you hope to gain from our mentoring relationship?"
- "What does success look like for you 6 months from now?"
- "What's your biggest area for development right now?"
- Share your perspective on what you can offer

**3. Working Agreement (15 minutes)**
Discuss and align on:
- **Frequency:** How often will you meet?
- **Duration:** How long will meetings be?
- **Format:** In-person, virtual, or hybrid?
- **Communication:** Between meetings - email, text, none?
- **Confidentiality:** What stays between you?
- **Boundaries:** What's in/out of scope?
- **Commitment:** How long will relationship last?
- **Flexibility:** How will you handle scheduling issues?

**4. Initial Developmental Conversation (15 minutes)**
- "Tell me about a current challenge you're facing"
- Begin practicing the mentoring skills you learned in Module 02
- Demonstrate what future sessions will be like

**5. Next Steps and Closing (5 minutes)**
- Schedule next 2-3 meetings
- Any pre-work or reflection for next time?
- Share any resources
- "What's one thing you're taking away from today?"

<h3>The Mentoring Agreement</h3>

Consider creating a simple written agreement covering:

**Logistics:**
- Meeting frequency and duration
- Preferred communication methods
- How to handle cancellations

**Goals:**
- 2-3 primary development goals
- How you'll track progress

**Expectations:**
- What mentee can expect from you
- What you expect from mentee
- Boundaries and limitations

**Confidentiality:**
- What stays private
- Any exceptions
- Permission to share successes

**Duration and Review:**
- Length of commitment (e.g., 6 months, 1 year)
- Check-in points to evaluate fit
- How relationship will end

> A simple email summary works fine - no need for formal documentation unless your organization requires it.

<h3>Common First Meeting Mistakes</h3>

**Doing All the Talking:**
- Resist the urge to share your entire career story
- Aim for 70% mentee talking, 30% mentor

**Skipping the Working Agreement:**
- Assumptions about meetings cause problems later
- Invest time upfront to align

**Moving Too Fast to Advice:**
- First meeting is about understanding, not solving
- Demonstrate curiosity over expertise

**Not Addressing Fit:**
- If you're not the right mentor, say so kindly
- Better to redirect early than disappoint later

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: First Meeting Role Play</b></p>

In this exercise you will practice conducting a first mentoring meeting.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Paired Practice (15 minutes per round):**

**Round 1:**

- Conduct a condensed first meeting (12 minutes)
- Focus especially on connection and working agreement

**Debrief (3 minutes):**
- What went well?
- What would you do differently?

**Round 2:**
- Switch roles
- Use a different mentee persona
- Repeat

**Mentee Personas Provided:**
1. Mid-career professional seeking work-life balance guidance
2. Early career person wanting to build executive presence
3. Someone considering a major career pivot
4. Technical expert wanting to move into leadership

**Group Discussion (10 minutes):**

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2 id="02"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">3.2 Ongoing Session Structure</h2>

After the first meeting, you'll settle into a rhythm for ongoing sessions. Having a flexible structure helps both parties make the most of your time together.

<h3>Standard Session Template</h3>

**Opening (5 minutes)**
- Check in personally: "How are you, really?"
- Reconnect since last meeting
- Notice energy and presence

**Review and Accountability (10 minutes)**
- "What's happened since we last met?"
- "What did you experiment with or try?"
- Celebrate progress, learn from setbacks
- No judgment, just curiosity

**Focus for Today (5 minutes)**
- "What's most important to talk about today?"
- "What would make this time together valuable?"
- "Where are you stuck or need perspective?"
- Let mentee drive the agenda

**Deep Exploration (30 minutes)**
- Use skills from Module 02: listening, questioning, feedback
- Go below surface issues to root causes
- Connect to patterns and themes
- Facilitate reflection and insight

**Action and Commitment (5 minutes)**
- "What are you taking away from today?"
- "What will you try before next time?"
- "What support do you need?"
- Keep commitments small and specific

**Closing (5 minutes)**
- Confirm next meeting
- Any resources to share
- "How was this session for you?"
- Quick feedback on what's working

> This 60-minute structure can be compressed to 30 or 45 minutes by adjusting the deep exploration time.

<h3>Adapting the Structure</h3>

Not every session will follow this template. Adapt based on:

**Crisis or Urgent Situation:**
- Skip review and accountability
- Go straight to what's pressing
- Focus on immediate support and next steps

**Progress Review Session:**
- Extend review and accountability
- Reflect on growth over multiple months
- Assess whether goals need adjusting

**Skills Development Focus:**
- Dedicate middle section to practicing specific skills
- Role play challenging conversations
- Work through frameworks together

**Career Planning Session:**
- Longer exploration of options and paths
- Vision casting for the future
- Strategic mapping

**Celebration Session:**
- Acknowledge major accomplishment
- Reflect on what made success possible
- Identify transferable lessons

<h3>Maintaining Momentum</h3>

**Consistency Matters:**
- Regular meetings (even brief ones) beat sporadic long ones
- Protect the calendar time
- Reschedule promptly when needed

**Track Themes Across Sessions:**
- Keep brief notes on topics, insights, commitments
- Notice patterns over time
- Reference previous conversations

**Mix Depths:**
- Some sessions go deep on one thing
- Others cover multiple topics
- Some are just check-ins
- Variety keeps engagement high

**Vary Locations (if in person):**
- Office meetings
- Walking conversations
- Coffee shops
- Different settings unlock different conversations

<h3>When Sessions Feel Stuck</h3>

If conversations start feeling routine or unproductive:

**Name It:**
- "I notice we seem to be covering familiar ground. What do you notice?"
- "Something feels different today. What's going on?"

**Shake Up the Format:**
- Take the conversation outside
- Use visual tools or whiteboards
- Invite a third person for one session
- Try a completely different structure

**Revisit Goals:**
- "Are we working on the right things?"
- "What's changed since we started?"
- "What do you need now that's different from then?"

**Check the Relationship:**
- "How is our mentoring relationship working for you?"
- "What could I do differently?"
- "Is there something we're not talking about that we should?"

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Session Planning Practice</b></p>

In this exercise you will practice planning and conducting an ongoing mentoring session.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Individual Preparation (5 minutes):**
- Review the scenario you're given
- Plan how you'll structure the 20-minute session
- Identify which skills from Module 02 you'll emphasize

**Paired Practice (20 minutes):**
- One person mentors, one is mentee
- Follow your structure
- Observer (facilitator or timer) tracks time

**Feedback (5 minutes):**
- Mentee shares what worked
- Observer provides observations
- Mentor reflects on what they'd change

**Scenarios Provided:**
1. Mentee struggling with imposter syndrome
2. Mentee received difficult feedback from their manager
3. Mentee considering leaving their organization
4. Mentee celebrating a big win but already anxious about next challenge

<h2 id="03"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">3.3 Conversation Frameworks and Models</h2>

Several proven frameworks can guide your mentoring conversations. Learning multiple models gives you flexibility to adapt to different situations and mentee needs.

<h3>3.3.1 The GROW Model</h3>

Developed by Sir John Whitmore, GROW is one of the most widely-used coaching and mentoring frameworks.

**G - Goal:**
- "What do you want to achieve?"
- "What would success look like?"
- "What's the specific outcome you're after?"

**R - Reality:**
- "What's the current situation?"
- "What have you tried so far?"
- "What's getting in the way?"

**O - Options:**
- "What are all the possible approaches?"
- "What else could you try?"
- "If there were no constraints, what would you do?"

**W - Will/Way Forward:**
- "What will you actually do?"
- "When will you do it?"
- "What support do you need?"

> GROW works well for specific challenges or decisions, less well for open-ended exploration.

<h3>3.3.2 The 5 Whys</h3>

A technique for getting to root causes by asking "Why?" repeatedly.

**Example:**
- Mentee: "I'm frustrated at work"
- Mentor: "Why are you frustrated?"
- Mentee: "My ideas never get implemented"
- Mentor: "Why don't they get implemented?"
- Mentee: "I don't think leadership trusts my judgment"
- Mentor: "Why might they not trust your judgment?"
- Mentee: "I haven't built relationships with them"
- Mentor: "Why haven't you built those relationships?"
- Mentee: "I've been avoiding them because I'm intimidated"

Now you've moved from frustration (surface) to relationship-building and confidence (root).

**Key Tips:**
- Sometimes it's 3 whys, sometimes 7
- Can feel interrogating - soften with: "Help me understand why..."
- The mentee often knows they've hit the real issue when they feel it

<h3>3.3.3 The ORID Model (Focused Conversation)</h3>

From the Institute of Cultural Affairs, this model moves through four levels:

**O - Objective:**
- Facts, data, what happened
- "What did you observe?"
- "What actually occurred?"

**R - Reflective:**
- Feelings, emotions, reactions
- "How did that make you feel?"
- "What was your initial reaction?"

**I - Interpretive:**
- Meaning, significance, learning
- "What does this mean?"
- "What are you learning?"

**D - Decisional:**
- Implications, actions, next steps
- "So what are you going to do?"
- "What changes as a result?"

> ORID is excellent for processing experiences and deriving learning.

<h3>3.3.4 The Challenge-Choice-Consequence Model</h3>

Helps mentees think through decisions:

**Challenge:**
- "What's the decision or choice you're facing?"
- "What's making this difficult?"

**Choices:**
- "What are your options?" (List them all)
- "Are there other possibilities?"

**Consequences:**
- For each choice: "What would happen if you chose this?"
- "What's the upside? Downside?"
- "What would you gain? What would you lose?"

Then: "Given all that, what feels right to you?"

<h3>3.3.5 The OSCAR Model</h3>

Particularly good for career development conversations:

**O - Outcome:**
- Long-term aspirations and vision
- "Where do you want to be in 3-5 years?"

**S - Situation:**
- Current reality and starting point
- "Where are you now?"

**C - Choices:**
- Options and paths to consider
- "What are the possible routes?"

**A - Actions:**
- Specific next steps
- "What's the first move?"

**R - Review:**
- Progress check and learning
- "How will you know you're on track?"

<h3>Mixing and Matching</h3>

You don't need to use a full model every session:
- Pull individual elements that fit
- Combine parts of different models
- Let conversation flow naturally, using models as guides not scripts

The models give you structure when you need it and ensure you don't skip important elements.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Framework Application Practice</b></p>

In this exercise you will practice applying conversation frameworks to real mentoring scenarios.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Small Groups (15 minutes):**

Each group receives 2 scenarios and must:
1. Determine which framework(s) would work best
2. Map out the questions you'd ask
3. Anticipate where the conversation might go

**Scenarios:**
1. Mentee can't decide between two job opportunities
2. Mentee had a failure they're struggling to process
3. Mentee feels stuck in their career with no clear direction
4. Mentee wants to develop a specific skill

**Gallery Walk (5 minutes):**
- Post your frameworks on the wall
- Walk around and see others' approaches
- Add sticky notes with additions or questions

**Discussion (10 minutes):**
- What made certain frameworks fit certain situations?
- When would you use GROW vs. ORID vs. others?
- How rigid should you be with these models?

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2 id="04"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">3.4 Between-Session Practices</h2>

Mentoring happens not just in scheduled meetings but in the weeks between. Thoughtful between-session practices deepen learning and maintain momentum.

<h3>What Mentors Do Between Sessions</h3>

**Reflect on Sessions:**
- What themes emerged?
- What did you learn about your mentee?
- What questions lingered?
- What do you want to explore next time?

**Send Resources:**
- Article related to their challenge
- Book recommendation
- Podcast episode
- TED talk or video
- Connection to someone who could help

*Guidelines:*
- Don't overwhelm - one resource, not ten
- Explain why this specific resource for them
- No expectation they consume it all
- "This made me think of you..."

**Make Introductions:**
- Connect mentee with people in your network
- Facilitate informational interviews
- Open doors to opportunities
- Always ask permission first: "Would it be helpful if I introduced you to X?"

**Note Key Commitments:**
- Track what they said they'd try
- Don't micromanage, but remember
- Demonstrates you're invested

**Celebrate Wins:**
- If you hear about a success, acknowledge it
- Brief email or text: "Congrats on X!"
- Shows you're paying attention

<h3>What Mentees Should Do Between Sessions</h3>

Help your mentee develop productive between-session habits:

**Implement Learning:**
- Try new behaviors discussed
- Experiment with different approaches
- Take small actions aligned with goals

**Reflect and Journal:**
- Process what they're learning
- Notice patterns in their reactions
- Track progress and insights

**Consume Resources:**
- Read/watch materials shared
- Come prepared to discuss
- Find their own relevant resources

**Practice Skills:**
- Role play difficult conversations
- Try new communication techniques
- Build capabilities incrementally

**Track Progress:**
- Keep list of commitments and outcomes
- Notice what's changing
- Gather evidence of growth

<h3>Communication Between Sessions</h3>

**Set Clear Norms:**
- Decide together what's appropriate
- Some mentors prefer email only
- Others are comfortable with text
- Clarify response time expectations

**Quick Questions Are OK:**
- Brief emails welcomed: "Quick question..."
- Mentee doesn't need permission for everything
- But shouldn't substitute for session work

**Crisis Communication:**
- Define what constitutes a crisis
- How to reach you in urgent situations
- What level of support you can provide

**Avoid Over-Functioning:**
- Don't become mentee's therapist or manager
- Maintain boundaries
- Resist urge to solve everything immediately

<h3>Tools and Templates</h3>

Consider providing mentees with:

**Session Preparation Template:**
```
Before our next meeting:

1. What happened since we last met?
   - Successes:
   - Challenges:
   - Experiments tried:

2. What I'm learning about myself:

3. What I most want to discuss today:

4. Questions I have:
```

**Reflection Prompts:**
- What am I becoming more aware of?
- What patterns am I noticing?
- What's getting in my way?
- What do I want to do differently?

**Action Tracker:**
- Simple spreadsheet: Date | Commitment | Status | Learning

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Resource Curation Exercise</b></p>

In this exercise you will build a resource library for mentees on common topics.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Individual Work (7 minutes):**

Choose 2 common mentee challenges from this list:
- Building confidence
- Work-life balance
- Difficult conversations
- Career transitions
- Leadership development
- Networking
- Managing up

For each, identify:
- One article (actual or imagined)
- One book
- One person in your network who could help

**Paired Sharing (8 minutes):**
- Share your resources
- Explain why you chose each
- Learn from your partner's selections

**Group Resource Bank (10 minutes):**
- Facilitator creates shared document
- Everyone adds their top resources
- You leave with a rich library to draw on

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2 id="05"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">3.5 Closure and Transition</h2>

All mentoring relationships eventually end - or at least transition. Thoughtful closure honors the relationship and sets both parties up for continued success.

<h3>When to End Formal Mentoring</h3>

Consider transitioning when:

**Goals Have Been Met:**
- Mentee has achieved what they set out to
- Ready to apply learning independently
- Time for new developmental challenges

**Relationship Has Run Its Course:**
- Conversations feel repetitive
- Neither party getting much value
- Natural endpoint reached

**Circumstances Change:**
- One person leaves organization
- Schedules no longer align
- Life transitions make commitment difficult

**Planned Duration Reached:**
- You agreed to 6 months or 1 year
- Time to assess continuation vs. closure

> Ending doesn't mean failure - it means the relationship served its purpose.

<h3>The Closure Conversation</h3>

Schedule a dedicated final session (or two) for closure:

**1. Reflect on the Journey (20 minutes)**
- "What do you remember about our first conversation?"
- "How have you grown over this time?"
- "What were the most significant moments or insights?"
- "What surprised you about this process?"

**2. Harvest the Learning (15 minutes)**
- "What are your key takeaways?"
- "What will you continue doing?"
- "What capabilities have you built?"
- "What do you understand about yourself now that you didn't before?"

**3. Look Forward (15 minutes)**
- "What are your next developmental goals?"
- "What support structures will you maintain?"
- "Who else could support your continued growth?"
- "What would make you proud to look back on a year from now?"

**4. Express Gratitude (10 minutes)**
- Share what you gained from the relationship
- Acknowledge the mentee's commitment and growth
- Express appreciation for trust and vulnerability
- Exchange what you'll remember most

<h3>Types of Endings</h3>

**Complete Closure:**
- Formal mentoring relationship ends
- May continue as professional contacts
- Less frequent connection

**Transition to Peer Relationship:**
- Shift from mentor-mentee to colleague-colleague
- More reciprocal exchange
- Different kind of friendship

**Continued Connection:**
- Less frequent touch-points (quarterly vs. monthly)
- Available as needed basis
- Check-ins on major decisions or transitions

**Intentional Pause:**
- Take a break for 3-6 months
- Revisit whether to continue
- Allows fresh perspective

<h3>Avoiding Common Closure Pitfalls</h3>

**Don't Ghost:**
- Relationships that just fade without acknowledgment
- Leave both parties uncertain
- Miss opportunity for learning

**Don't Drag it Out:**
- If it's time, have the conversation
- Delaying makes it more awkward
- Trust your instincts

**Don't Make it About You:**
- If mentee is ready to move on, celebrate that
- Your value isn't measured by dependency
- Success means they don't need you anymore

**Do Leave Door Open:**
- "I'm always available for big questions"
- "Let's touch base in 6 months"
- Make it easy to reconnect if needed

<h3>After the Relationship</h3>

**For Mentors:**
- Reflect on what you learned
- Update your mentoring approach
- Celebrate their success as they progress
- Be available if they reach back out

**For Mentees:**
- Continue applying what they learned
- Consider mentoring others
- Pay it forward
- Maintain connection appropriately

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Planning a Closure Conversation</b></p>

In this exercise you will plan and practice a mentoring relationship closure conversation.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Individual Reflection (5 minutes):**

Imagine you're ending a 9-month mentoring relationship. The mentee has grown significantly. Plan:
- 3 questions you'll ask to facilitate reflection
- What you'll share about what you gained
- How you'll frame the transition

**Paired Practice (10 minutes each direction):**

Take turns:
- One person facilitates closure conversation (8 minutes)
- Other responds as mentee
- Brief debrief (2 minutes)

**Group Discussion (10 minutes):**
- What made closure conversations powerful?
- What's hard about endings?
- How does good closure set up future success?
- What would you do in your real mentoring relationships?
