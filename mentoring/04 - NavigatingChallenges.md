<h2 id="01"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">4.1 Boundaries and Ethical Considerations</h2>

Healthy boundaries protect both mentor and mentee, creating a safe container for developmental work while preventing burnout, dependency, or inappropriate relationships.

<h3>Understanding Professional Boundaries</h3>

Boundaries define what is and isn't part of the mentoring relationship. They include:

**Time Boundaries:**
- Agreed-upon meeting schedule
- Response time for communications
- Availability outside scheduled sessions
- Duration of overall relationship

**Scope Boundaries:**
- Topics appropriate for mentoring vs. therapy
- Personal vs. professional focus
- What you're qualified to address
- What requires other expertise

**Relational Boundaries:**
- Level of friendship vs. professional relationship
- Appropriate self-disclosure
- Social media connections
- Involvement in mentee's personal life

**Organizational Boundaries:**
- Confidentiality parameters
- Reporting relationships if applicable
- Potential conflicts of interest
- Organizational politics

<h3>Setting Boundaries from the Start</h3>

The best time to establish boundaries is in your first meeting:

**Be Explicit:**
- "I'm available for our scheduled hour each month"
- "I'm comfortable with brief email questions between sessions"
- "I typically respond within 24-48 hours"
- "Topics X, Y, Z are outside my expertise"

**Frame Positively:**
- Not: "Don't call me after 5pm"
- Instead: "The best way to reach me is email during business hours"

**Explain the Why:**
- "These boundaries help me be fully present when we do meet"
- "This ensures I can sustain mentoring multiple people"
- "This protects both our interests"

<h3>Common Boundary Challenges</h3>

**The Dependent Mentee:**
- *Signs:* Frequent contact, can't make decisions without checking in, panics when you're unavailable
- *Response:* "I notice you're reaching out a lot. Part of my job is to help you trust your own judgment. What would you do if I weren't available?"

**The Boundary-Pusher:**
- *Signs:* Repeatedly contacts outside agreed times, asks for inappropriate favors, shares overly personal information
- *Response:* "I want to help you, and I need to maintain our agreement about [boundary]. Can we revisit our working agreement?"

**The Friendship Confusion:**
- *Signs:* Relationship shifts from developmental to purely social, mentee expects friend-level involvement
- *Response:* "I care about you as a person, and our relationship is primarily developmental. That means..."

**The Crisis Situation:**
- *Signs:* Mentee shares serious personal/mental health issues
- *Response:* See "When to Refer" section below

<h3>Ethical Considerations</h3>

**Confidentiality:**

*What to keep confidential:*
- Content of mentoring conversations
- Mentee's challenges and vulnerabilities
- Specific goals and development areas
- Personal information shared

*Exceptions:*
- Risk of harm to self or others
- Illegal activity
- Organizational policy requirements (clearly communicated upfront)

**Conflicts of Interest:**

Avoid mentoring relationships where:
- You have evaluative authority over the person
- You're competing for same opportunities
- You have personal relationships that complicate dynamics
- Financial interests are at stake

**Power Dynamics:**

Be mindful of:
- Organizational hierarchy
- Demographic differences (age, race, gender, etc.)
- Social capital and privilege differences
- Potential for exploitation or coercion

**Dual Relationships:**

Tread carefully when:
- Mentee becomes your direct report
- Personal friendship develops
- Business partnerships emerge
- Family connections exist

> When in doubt about an ethical situation, consult with HR, a senior mentor, or trusted colleague before proceeding.

<h3>When You Need to Adjust Boundaries</h3>

Boundaries aren't static. You may need to adjust when:
- Your capacity changes (new job, personal circumstances)
- Mentee's needs exceed what you can provide
- Relationship dynamics shift
- Either person feels uncomfortable

**How to Adjust:**
1. Name what you're noticing
2. Explain the adjustment needed
3. Collaborate on solution
4. Document the agreement

"I've noticed [pattern]. For me to continue being effective, I need [adjustment]. How does that work for you?"

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Boundary Dilemmas</b></p>

In this exercise you will analyze boundary scenarios and determine appropriate responses.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Small Groups (15 minutes):**

Each group receives 2-3 boundary dilemma cards. For each, discuss:
- What boundary is at risk?
- What are the risks of not addressing it?
- How would you respond?
- What would you say specifically?

**Dilemma Examples:**

1. Your mentee texts you at 10pm on a Friday asking for urgent advice about a decision they need to make Monday morning.

2. Your mentee invites you to their wedding. You've been meeting for 8 months and have a great relationship.

3. Your mentee starts sharing detailed personal problems about their marriage and asks your advice.

4. Your mentee asks you to intervene with their manager about a conflict they're having.

5. Your mentee wants to meet weekly instead of monthly because they're "getting so much value."

6. Your mentee sends you a LinkedIn request and starts commenting on all your posts.

**Group Presentations (10 minutes):**
- Each group shares one dilemma and their response
- Others provide additional perspectives

**Facilitated Discussion (10 minutes):**
- What made these situations challenging?
- What principles guided your responses?
- When is flexibility appropriate vs. holding firm?

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2 id="02"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">4.2 Common Challenging Scenarios</h2>

Even with the best intentions and skills, you'll encounter difficult situations. Being prepared helps you respond effectively rather than reactively.

<h3>Scenario 1: The Mentee Who Doesn't Follow Through</h3>

**The Situation:**
Mentee enthusiastically agrees to actions in each session but never implements them. Progress stalls.

**Why It Happens:**
- Overcommitting in the moment
- Lack of true ownership
- Obstacles they haven't shared
- Fear of failure or change
- Not the right goals

**How to Address:**

*Step 1 - Notice and Name:*
"I'm noticing a pattern where we agree on actions but they don't happen. What are you noticing?"

*Step 2 - Explore Together:*
- "What's getting in the way?"
- "Are these the right commitments?"
- "What would need to be different for you to follow through?"

*Step 3 - Adjust Approach:*
- Smaller commitments
- Different types of actions
- More accountability structure
- Revisit whether goals are truly theirs

*Step 4 - Name the Stakes:*
"Without action between sessions, it's hard to make progress. What would make this mentoring relationship valuable for you?"

<h3>Scenario 2: The Mentee Who Wants You to Fix Everything</h3>

**The Situation:**
Mentee comes looking for answers and solutions rather than doing their own thinking.

**Why It Happens:**
- Learned helplessness
- You've been too directive
- Culture of being told what to do
- Lack of confidence in own judgment

**How to Address:**

*Shift the Dynamic:*
"I notice you're asking what I would do. What are your thoughts first?"

*Reflect the Pattern:*
"I'm noticing I'm doing a lot of the thinking here. That's not serving you well. What do you notice?"

*Use Powerful Questions:*
- "What have you already considered?"
- "What would you advise a friend in this situation?"
- "What does your gut tell you?"

*Acknowledge and Redirect:*
"I appreciate that you trust my judgment, and you'll be most successful when you trust your own. Walk me through your thinking..."

<h3>Scenario 3: The Mentee Who Disagrees with Your Feedback</h3>

**The Situation:**
You share feedback or observations and mentee becomes defensive or dismissive.

**Why It Happens:**
- Feedback triggered shame or fear
- Delivery was off
- Not ready to hear it
- Genuinely different perspective

**How to Address:**

*Acknowledge the Reaction:*
"I sense this feedback landed hard. Tell me what's coming up for you."

*Clarify It's Data, Not Truth:*
"This is what I'm observing, not absolute truth. Does any part of it resonate?"

*Explore Their Perspective:*
"Help me understand how you see this situation differently."

*Make It About Them:*
"Whether my feedback is accurate or not, your strong reaction tells me something important is here. What is it?"

*Give Space:*
"Take some time to sit with this. We can come back to it next time."

<h3>Scenario 4: The Mentee Who Isn't a Good Fit</h3>

**The Situation:**
You realize you're not the right mentor for this person's needs.

**Why It Happens:**
- Different expertise needed
- Chemistry isn't there
- Their needs exceed your capacity
- Values or style mismatch

**How to Address:**

*Name It Early:*
"As I learn more about what you're looking for, I'm wondering if I'm the best mentor for you."

*Be Specific:*
"Your goals around [X] require expertise in [Y], which isn't my strength. Let me help you find someone better suited."

*Offer Alternatives:*
"Here are three people who would be great for what you need. Would you like introductions?"

*Make It About Fit, Not Failure:*
"This isn't about you or me being wrong, it's about finding the right match. I want you to get the support you deserve."

<h3>Scenario 5: The Over-Sharing Mentee</h3>

**The Situation:**
Mentee shares very personal information that makes you uncomfortable or exceeds appropriate boundaries.

**Why It Happens:**
- Lack of other support systems
- Don't recognize boundaries
- Building trust through vulnerability (misguided)
- Mental health or personal crisis

**How to Address:**

*Interrupt Gently:*
"I'm going to pause you here. This sounds really difficult and I want you to have the right support for it."

*Clarify Your Role:*
"I care about your wellbeing, and this situation needs expertise I don't have. Let's talk about who could better help you with this."

*Redirect to Professional Help:*
"Have you considered talking with [therapist/EAP/HR/clergy/etc.]? They're trained to support people through situations like this."

*Set Boundary Compassionately:*
"I want to be clear about what I can and can't help with so I can be most useful to you."

<h3>Scenario 6: The Ghosting Mentee</h3>

**The Situation:**
Mentee cancels, reschedules repeatedly, or stops responding to communications.

**Why It Happens:**
- Other priorities taking over
- Avoiding difficult conversations
- Lost interest or value
- Personal or professional crisis
- Doesn't know how to end relationship

**How to Address:**

*Reach Out Directly:*
"I notice we've had trouble connecting lately. What's going on for you?"

*Name the Pattern:*
"We've rescheduled three times. It seems like this might not be the right time for mentoring. Am I reading that correctly?"

*Make It Easy to Exit:*
"If you need to step away from our mentoring relationship, that's completely okay. I'd just appreciate knowing rather than letting it drift."

*Offer Pause Option:*
"Would you prefer to take a break and reconnect in a few months when things settle down?"

*Know When to Let Go:*
After 2-3 unreturned attempts at contact, it's okay to close the loop with a final message:
"I've reached out a few times without hearing back. I'm going to assume you need to step away from our mentoring relationship for now. The door is always open if you'd like to reconnect in the future."

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Scenario Response Practice</b></p>

In this exercise you will role-play challenging scenarios and practice responding effectively.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Trios (18 minutes):**

Rotate through roles: Mentor, Mentee, Observer
6 minutes per scenario, 2 minutes per role

**Scenarios to Practice:**
1. Mentee hasn't completed any actions from last three sessions
2. Mentee becomes defensive when you offer feedback
3. Mentee wants you to talk to their manager on their behalf

**Process:**
- Mentor responds to situation using skills from workshop
- Mentee plays role authentically
- Observer notes what works and what could be better

**Group Debrief (12 minutes):**
- What was most challenging?
- What approaches worked?
- What language was particularly effective?

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2 id="03"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">4.3 When to Refer and How</h2>

One of the most important skills is recognizing when a situation exceeds your capacity or expertise and making appropriate referrals.

<h3>Situations Requiring Professional Referral</h3>

**Mental Health Concerns:**

*Red flags:*
- Expressions of hopelessness or suicidal thoughts
- Significant changes in behavior or appearance
- Substance abuse problems
- Symptoms of depression, anxiety, or other disorders
- Trauma responses

*Action:*
Immediate referral to mental health professional, EAP, or crisis services.

**Serious Personal Issues:**

*Examples:*
- Domestic violence
- Eating disorders
- Serious financial crisis
- Legal troubles
- Serious medical issues

*Action:*
Acknowledge the difficulty, express care, refer to appropriate professional.

**Performance Issues Requiring Management:**

*Examples:*
- Conflict with manager needing HR involvement
- Performance improvement plan situations
- Discrimination or harassment claims
- Potential termination scenarios

*Action:*
Clarify your role is developmental, not managerial. Encourage engagement with HR/management.

<h3>How to Make a Referral</h3>

**Step 1 - Express Care:**
"I can see this is really difficult for you and I want you to get the best support possible."

**Step 2 - Name Your Limitation:**
"This situation requires expertise that I don't have as a mentor."

**Step 3 - Provide Resources:**
"Here are some resources that could really help..." [Have specific referrals ready]

**Step 4 - Clarify Your Continued Role:**
"I'm still here to support your professional development, and you need additional support for this particular situation."

**Step 5 - Follow Up:**
Check in later: "Were you able to connect with [resource]? How can I continue supporting you?"

<h3>Referral Resources to Know</h3>

**Mental Health:**
- Employee Assistance Program (EAP)
- Crisis hotlines: 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline
- Mental health professionals
- Local crisis resources

**Career Services:**
- HR department
- Career counselors
- Executive coaches
- Outplacement services

**Legal/Financial:**
- Legal aid services
- Financial advisors
- Debt counseling services

**Organizational:**
- HR Business Partners
- Employee Resource Groups
- Ombudsperson
- Ethics hotline

> Create a personal referral list with contact information to have ready when needed.

<h3>The "Warm Handoff"</h3>

When appropriate and with permission:

1. **Get Permission:** "Would it be helpful if I introduced you to X?"
2. **Make Introduction:** Email or call introducing both parties
3. **Provide Context:** "Y is looking for support with Z"
4. **Step Back:** Let the new relationship develop
5. **Check In:** Follow up on how it went

<h3>When Referral Feels Like Rejection</h3>

Mentees may feel abandoned when you refer them. Mitigate this by:

**Normalizing:**
"Many people need specialized support for situations like this. It's a sign of strength to seek the right help."

**Affirming Relationship:**
"This doesn't change our mentoring relationship. I'm still here for your professional development."

**Staying Connected:**
"Let's still meet next month as planned."

**Being Specific:**
"I'm not equipped to help with X, but I'm absolutely here to help with Y and Z."

In this exercise you will identify and document referral resources you can use.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Individual Work (10 minutes):**

Create a personal referral resource list:
1. Mental health resources (EAP, crisis lines, therapists)
2. HR contacts and employee resources
3. Career professionals (coaches, counselors)
4. Financial/legal resources
5. Specialized mentors in your network

**Paired Sharing (8 minutes):**
- Compare lists
- Add resources your partner identified

- Each person adds 1-2 resources
- Everyone leaves with comprehensive list

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2 id="04"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">4.4 Maintaining Engagement and Momentum</h2>

Sustaining energy and momentum in mentoring relationships over months or years requires intentionality and periodic renewal.

<h3>Why Relationships Lose Momentum</h3>

Common patterns:

**Natural Progression:**
- Initial goals achieved
- Relationship has run its course
- Time for new challenges

**Scheduling Drift:**
- One or both parties frequently reschedule
- Gaps between meetings grow longer
- Life gets busy

**Routine Rut:**
- Conversations become repetitive
- No new ground covered
- Feels more like social chat than development

**Goal Misalignment:**
- Original goals no longer relevant
- Mentee's needs have changed
- Context has shifted

**Relationship Stagnation:**
- Dynamic feels stale
- Not enough challenge or support
- Chemistry has changed

<h3>Strategies to Maintain Momentum</h3>

**Regular Check-ins on the Relationship:**

Every 3-4 months, ask:
- "How is our mentoring relationship working for you?"
- "What's been most valuable?"
- "What should we do more of? Less of?"
- "Are we working on the right things?"
- "Do our goals need updating?"

**Vary the Format:**

Break routine by:
- Walking meetings instead of sitting
- Different locations
- Virtual one month, in-person next
- Bring in a guest expert for one session
- Attend an event together

**Set Fresh Goals:**

When original goals are met:
- Celebrate the achievement
- Co-create new development areas
- Consider bigger, bolder goals
- Explore emerging interests

**Introduce New Tools:**

Periodically use:
- Assessments (StrengthsFinder, DISC, etc.)
- Books you read together
- Articles to discuss
- Case studies to analyze
- New conversation frameworks

**Create Shared Projects:**

Occasionally work together on:
- Conference presentation
- Article or blog post
- Community initiative
- Research project
- Event organization

**Milestone Reflections:**

At 3, 6, 9, 12 months:
- Review progress since beginning
- Identify growth and learning
- Adjust approach as needed
- Recommit or plan closure

<h3>The Power of Accountability Partnerships</h3>

Transform some check-ins into accountability sessions:
- Both share current challenges
- Set commitments for next time
- Report back on progress
- More reciprocal and energizing

<h3>When to Take a Break</h3>

Sometimes the best way to sustain a relationship is to pause:

**Planned Break:**
- "Let's take summer off and reconnect in September"
- "After we hit this milestone, let's pause and see if continuing makes sense"

**Responsive Break:**
- "It seems like a lot is competing for your attention. Want to pause and revisit in a few months?"
- "I'm sensing we might both need some space. Let's take a break and check in later."

**How to Frame It:**
"This isn't ending our relationship, it's creating space to see if and how we want to continue."

<h3>Signs of a Healthy, Sustained Relationship</h3>

You'll know it's working when:
- Both parties look forward to meetings
- Conversations go deep quickly (established trust)
- There's progress toward meaningful goals
- Both are learning and growing
- Relationship adapts as needs change
- Mutual respect and appreciation evident
- Easy to have honest conversations
- Commitment is sustained without force

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Relationship Health Check</b></p>

In this exercise you will develop a tool for assessing mentoring relationship health.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Small Groups (12 minutes):**

Create a "Mentoring Relationship Health Check" with:
- 8-10 questions to assess relationship health
- Mix of yes/no and open-ended questions
- Cover different aspects (trust, progress, engagement, etc.)
- Design for use by mentor with mentee together

**Gallery Walk (5 minutes):**
- Post health checks around room
- Review others' approaches
- Note questions you want to borrow

**Create Personal Tool (8 minutes):**
- Build your own health check drawing from best of all
- Commit to when you'll use it with mentees

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2 id="05"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">4.5 Your Ongoing Development as a Mentor</h2>

Becoming an excellent mentor is a lifelong journey. The best mentors continuously develop their capabilities and learn from every relationship.

<h3>Reflective Practice</h3>

**After Each Session:**

Spend 5-10 minutes reflecting:
- What went well?
- What was challenging?
- What did I learn about this mentee?
- What do I want to remember for next time?
- What skill do I want to develop?

**Monthly Review:**

Look across all mentoring relationships:
