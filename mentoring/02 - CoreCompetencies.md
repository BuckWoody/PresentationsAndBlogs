<h2 id="01"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">2.1 Building Trust and Psychological Safety</h2>

Trust is the foundation of every effective mentoring relationship. Without it, mentees won't share real challenges, take risks, or be vulnerable about growth areas. Everything else you'll learn in this workshop depends on establishing and maintaining trust.

<h3>What is Trust in Mentoring?</h3>

In mentoring relationships, trust means:

**Confidentiality:** What's shared stays between mentor and mentee (with rare exceptions for safety)<br>
**Reliability:** Following through on commitments, showing up consistently<br>
**Honesty:** Providing candid feedback and authentic responses<br>
**Non-judgment:** Creating space for struggles without shame<br>
**Competence:** Demonstrating relevant expertise and wisdom<br>
**Care:** Genuinely investing in the mentee's wellbeing and success<br>

> Research by Google's Project Aristotle found psychological safety was the #1 predictor of team effectiveness. The same applies to mentoring relationships.

<h3>Building Trust from the Start</h3>

Trust begins in your first conversation. Key practices:

**1. Establish Clear Agreements**
- Discuss and agree on confidentiality boundaries
- Define what success looks like together
- Set expectations for communication and meeting frequency
- Clarify roles and responsibilities

**2. Demonstrate Presence**
- Give undivided attention during meetings
- Put away devices, close laptop
- Make eye contact, use open body language
- Be mentally and emotionally present

**3. Show Authentic Interest**
- Ask about the mentee as a whole person, not just their professional role
- Remember details they share
- Follow up on previous conversations
- Celebrate their wins, big and small

**4. Practice Transparency**
- Share your own struggles and learning experiences
- Admit when you don't know something
- Be honest about your limitations and boundaries
- Model vulnerability appropriately

**5. Honor Commitments**
- Do what you say you'll do
- Show up on time, every time
- Follow through on introductions or resources you promise
- If you can't meet a commitment, communicate proactively

<h3>Psychological Safety in Practice</h3>

Psychological safety means mentees feel safe to:
- Share mistakes and failures without fear of judgment
- Ask "dumb" questions
- Challenge your perspectives respectfully
- Express doubts and concerns
- Show emotion when appropriate
- Disagree or push back

You create psychological safety through:
- Normalizing struggle and imperfection
- Responding to vulnerability with empathy, not fixes
- Avoiding "should" statements that imply judgment
- Thanking mentees for their honesty and courage
- Sharing your own examples of failure and learning

<h3>Warning Signs of Low Trust</h3>

Be alert for indicators that trust needs strengthening:
- Mentee shares only surface-level issues
- Conversations feel stiff or formal
- Mentee doesn't implement suggestions between meetings
- Cancellations or rescheduling become frequent
- Mentee doesn't ask follow-up questions
- You sense they're performing or telling you what you want to hear

If you notice these patterns, address trust directly: "I sense some hesitation. What would help you feel more comfortable being open with me?"

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Trust Builders and Trust Breakers</b></p>

In this exercise you will identify specific behaviors that build or break trust in mentoring relationships.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Small Groups (10 minutes):**

Your group will receive either "Trust Builders" or "Trust Breakers" cards:

*Trust Builders Group:*
- Generate a list of 8-10 specific behaviors that build trust
- Be concrete: instead of "be reliable," say "respond to emails within 24 hours"
- Consider verbal, non-verbal, and action-based behaviors

*Trust Breakers Group:*
- Generate a list of 8-10 specific behaviors that damage trust
- Include subtle trust breakers, not just obvious ones
- Think about early relationship and later stages

**Gallery Walk (5 minutes):**
- Post your lists around the room
- Walk around and read other groups' lists
- Add sticky notes with additional ideas

**Large Group Discussion (5 minutes):**
- What surprised you?
- Which trust breakers are easiest to accidentally commit?
- How quickly can trust be built? How quickly can it be broken?

<h2 id="02"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">2.2 Active Listening</h2>

Active listening is perhaps the most important skill in mentoring. It's not just hearing words - it's fully engaging with what the mentee is communicating verbally and non-verbally, and demonstrating that understanding.

<h3>Levels of Listening</h3>

Most people operate at different levels of listening:

**Level 1: Internal Listening (Listening to Yourself)**
- Focused on your own thoughts, responses, judgments
- Waiting for your turn to talk
- Comparing their experience to yours
- Planning what you'll say next

**Level 2: Focused Listening (Listening to Them)**
- Attention fully on the mentee
- Hearing their words, tone, emotion
- Observing body language
- Suspending your own agenda

**Level 3: Global Listening (Listening to Everything)**
- Aware of what's not being said
- Sensing energy shifts and emotional undercurrents
- Picking up environmental factors
- Intuiting deeper meaning

Effective mentors operate primarily at Levels 2 and 3, occasionally referencing Level 1 to share relevant experience.

<h3>Active Listening Techniques</h3>

**Minimal Encouragers:**
- Use brief responses to show you're engaged: "mm-hmm," "I see," "go on"
- Head nods and appropriate facial expressions
- Leaning slightly forward

**Paraphrasing:**
- Restate what you heard in your own words
- "So what I'm hearing is..."
- "It sounds like you're saying..."
- Confirms understanding and shows you're tracking

**Reflecting Feelings:**
- Name the emotions you're sensing
- "You seem frustrated by that situation"
- "I'm hearing excitement in your voice about this opportunity"
- Helps mentee become more self-aware

**Summarizing:**
- Capture key themes from longer conversations
- "Let me see if I've got this right - the main challenges you're facing are..."
- Helps mentee see patterns and priorities

**Silence:**
- Resist the urge to fill every pause
- Give mentee space to think and feel
- Count to 7 before jumping in after they finish speaking
- Some of the best insights emerge from silence

<h3>Barriers to Active Listening</h3>

Be aware of common barriers and actively work to overcome them:

**The Fix-It Trap:**
- Jumping to solutions before fully understanding
- Wanting to rescue rather than empower
- Remember: Your job is to facilitate their thinking, not solve their problems

**The Comparison Trap:**
- "When I was in that situation..."
- Making it about your experience rather than theirs
- While experience-sharing has its place, don't let it dominate

**The Judgment Trap:**
- Mentally criticizing their choices or perspectives
- Assuming you know better
- Your role is to understand, not evaluate

**The Distraction Trap:**
- Thinking about your next meeting
- Getting pulled into your own emotions or stories
- Letting external noises interrupt

**The Assumption Trap:**
- Thinking you know what they'll say
- Finishing their sentences
- Jumping to conclusions

<h3>Deepening Your Listening</h3>

To listen more deeply:

**Before Meetings:**
- Review notes from previous conversations
- Clear your mind and set intention to be fully present
- Put away all distractions

**During Conversations:**
- Notice when you drift to Level 1 listening
- Refocus on the mentee
- Track not just content but emotion and energy
- Listen for what matters most to them

**After Meetings:**
- Reflect on what you learned
- Notice patterns across conversations
- Identify what you might have missed

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Listening Levels Practice</b></p>

In this exercise you will practice identifying and shifting between different listening levels.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Demonstration (5 minutes):**
- Facilitator demonstrates Levels 1, 2, and 3 listening
- Participants identify what they observe at each level

**Paired Practice - Round 1 (8 minutes):**

Partner A talks for 3 minutes about a current work challenge
Partner B practices Level 1 listening (intentionally!)
- Think about your own similar experience
- Plan what advice you'd give
- Wait for your turn to talk

*Debrief:* How did it feel for speaker? For listener?

**Paired Practice - Round 2 (8 minutes):**

Same partners, new topic: something Partner A is excited about
Partner B practices Level 2 listening
- Full focus on Partner A
- Paraphrase and reflect feelings
- Use minimal encouragers

*Debrief:* How was this different?

**Reflection (4 minutes):**
- When do you naturally default to Level 1?
- What helps you shift to deeper listening?
- What will you practice in your next mentoring conversation?

<h2 id="03"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">2.3 Asking Powerful Questions</h2>

Questions are a mentor's most important tool. The right question at the right time can unlock insight, challenge assumptions, and catalyze growth. The wrong question can shut down thinking or lead mentees away from their own wisdom.

<h3>What Makes a Question "Powerful"?</h3>

Powerful questions:
- **Spark thinking** rather than requiring just factual recall
- **Invite exploration** instead of defending or justifying
- **Challenge assumptions** gently and productively
- **Connect to deeper values** and purpose
- **Generate energy** and insight in the mentee
- **Move them forward** toward action or awareness

<h3>Types of Questions</h3>

**Open vs. Closed Questions:**

*Closed questions:*
- Yes/no or short factual answers
- "Did you talk to your manager?"
- "Is this project a priority?"
- Useful for clarifying facts, but don't generate reflection

*Open questions:*
- Invite expansive thinking
- "What's your thinking about how to approach your manager?"
- "How does this project fit with your priorities?"
- Core tool for mentoring conversations

> Aim for 80-90% open questions in mentoring conversations.

**The Question Continuum:**

From less to more powerful:

1. **Information Gathering:** "What happened in that meeting?"
2. **Analysis:** "What factors contributed to that outcome?"
3. **Synthesis:** "What patterns do you notice across these situations?"
4. **Evaluation:** "What's working well? What's not?"
5. **Application:** "How might you apply that learning to your current challenge?"
6. **Creation:** "What would you create if there were no obstacles?"
7. **Self-Authorship:** "What does your inner wisdom tell you?"

<h3>Powerful Question Stems</h3>

Keep these in your mentoring toolkit:

**Exploring the Situation:**
- "What else is important about this?"
- "What's the context I should understand?"
- "What have you already tried?"

**Uncovering Assumptions:**
- "What are you assuming about X?"
- "What would need to be true for that to work?"
- "What if the opposite were true?"

**Expanding Possibilities:**
- "What are other ways you could approach this?"
- "What would you do if you weren't afraid?"
- "What advice would you give someone else in this situation?"

**Clarifying Values and Priorities:**
- "What matters most to you about this decision?"
- "What are you optimizing for?"
- "What would you regret not doing?"

**Generating Insight:**
- "What's the real challenge here for you?"
- "What are you learning about yourself?"
- "What's becoming clear as we talk?"

**Committing to Action:**
- "What's one step you could take this week?"
- "What support do you need?"
- "How will you know if you're making progress?"

**The Miracle Question:**
- "If you woke up tomorrow and this issue was resolved, what would be different?"
- Helps mentees envision desired outcomes

<h3>Questions to Avoid</h3>

**Leading Questions:**
- "Don't you think you should...?"
- "Wouldn't it be better if...?"
- Disguised advice that shuts down mentee's thinking

**Multiple Questions:**
- "What do you think about that opportunity and have you talked to anyone about it and what did your manager say?"
- Confusing; mentee doesn't know which to answer

**"Why" Questions (use sparingly):**
- "Why did you do that?"
- Can feel judgmental, put mentee on defensive
- Better: "What led you to that decision?"
- "Why" works for exploring purpose: "Why is this important to you?"

**Questions You Already Know the Answer To:**
- Testing rather than genuine inquiry
- Mentees sense this and it damages trust

<h3>The Power of Follow-Up Questions</h3>

Often the most powerful question is simply:
- "Tell me more about that"
- "Say more"
- "What else?"

These simple follow-ups go deeper than the first response and unlock new thinking.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Transforming Advice into Questions</b></p>

In this exercise you will practice converting advice statements into powerful questions.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Small Groups (10 minutes):**

You'll receive 6-8 common advice statements. For each, create 2-3 questions that might generate similar insight without telling the mentee what to do.

*Example:*
- Advice: "You should set clearer boundaries with your team"
- Questions: 
  - "How might clearer boundaries change your team dynamic?"
  - "What's getting in the way of setting boundaries?"
  - "What boundaries would serve you best right now?"

*Your turns:*
1. "You need to build a stronger relationship with your manager"
2. "You should delegate more"
3. "You're taking on too much"
4. "You need to be more strategic"
5. "You should speak up more in meetings"

**Paired Practice (10 minutes):**

Partner A shares a current challenge (2 minutes)
Partner B responds with 3 powerful questions (4 minutes)
- Notice which questions generate energy and insight
Debrief (2 minutes)

Switch roles and repeat

**Group Reflection (5 minutes):**
- What made questions powerful or not?
- What's challenging about asking instead of telling?
- What questions surprised you with their impact?

<h2 id="04"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">2.4 Giving Developmental Feedback</h2>

Feedback is critical for growth, but it's also one of the most anxiety-producing aspects of mentoring for both parties. Effective mentors learn to give feedback that is honest, specific, and truly developmental.

<h3>The Purpose of Feedback in Mentoring</h3>

Unlike performance feedback from a manager, mentoring feedback is:
- **Developmental** not evaluative
- **Offered** not required
- **Focused on growth** not correction
- **Based on patterns** not single incidents
- **Future-oriented** not past-focused

Your goal is to help mentees see themselves more clearly so they can choose how to grow.

<h3>The Feedback Equation</h3>

Effective developmental feedback includes three components:

**1. Observation (What you noticed)**
- Specific, objective behavior or pattern
- Data, not interpretation
- "I've noticed in our last three conversations, you've mentioned feeling overwhelmed"

**2. Impact (What effect it has)**
- How it affects them, others, or outcomes
- Connect behavior to consequences
- "...and I wonder if that's affecting your ability to focus on strategic priorities"

**3. Question or Invitation (What comes next)**
- Make it developmental, not directive
- Invite their reflection
- "...what are you noticing about that pattern?"

> Formula: "I've noticed [observation]. The impact seems to be [effect]. What do you make of that?" or "How do you want to handle it?"

<h3>Types of Developmental Feedback</h3>

**Reinforcing Feedback (Strengths):**
- Highlights what's working well
- Builds confidence and self-awareness
- "I want to call out how you handled that difficult conversation - you stayed calm and curious even when challenged. That's a real strength."

**Adjusting Feedback (Growth Areas):**
- Points out blind spots or patterns that limit effectiveness
- Requires trust and psychological safety
- "I've observed you often apologize before sharing ideas in meetings. I wonder if that undermines your credibility?"

**Feedforward (Future-Focused):**
- Suggests possibilities for future development
- Forward-looking rather than dwelling on past
- "For next time, what if you tried stating your idea first, then inviting questions?"

<h3>The SBI Model (Situation-Behavior-Impact)</h3>

A structured approach for specific feedback:

**Situation:** Set context
- "In yesterday's team meeting..."
- "When you presented your project update..."

**Behavior:** Describe what you observed
- "You spoke for 15 minutes without pausing"
- "You used a lot of technical jargon"

**Impact:** Share the effect
- "Several people seemed confused"
- "I noticed folks checking their phones"

Then add: "What was your intention? What would you do differently?"

<h3>The Feedback Sandwich - Don't</h3>

Avoid the traditional "feedback sandwich" (positive-negative-positive):
- Feels manipulative once people recognize the pattern
- Dilutes important developmental feedback
- Creates anxiety around compliments ("What's the 'but' coming?")

Instead: Give reinforcing and adjusting feedback separately, both genuinely and specifically.

<h3>Making Feedback Safe</h3>

**Permission-Based Feedback:**
- "Would you be open to some feedback about what I observed?"
- "Can I share a pattern I'm noticing?"
- Asking permission activates mentee's agency and reduces defensiveness

**Framing Feedback:**
- "This is data, not truth - does it resonate with you?"
- "I'm sharing this because I believe in your potential"
- "Take what's useful and leave the rest"

**Timing Matters:**
- Give feedback when you have time to discuss
- Not when either person is rushed or stressed
- Ideally close to the event but not in the heat of the moment

**Inviting Self-Assessment First:**
- "How do you think that went?"
- "What would you do differently?"
- Mentees often identify the same issues you noticed

<h3>Receiving Feedback on Your Mentoring</h3>

Model openness to feedback by inviting it regularly:
- "What's been most helpful in our conversations?"
- "What could I do differently to support you better?"
- "Is there anything I should stop doing?"

Respond to feedback by:
- Listening without defending
- Asking clarifying questions
- Thanking them for their honesty
- Acting on what you learn

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Feedback Practice Scenarios</b></p>

In this exercise you will practice delivering different types of developmental feedback.

<p><img style="margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

**Trios - Rotating Roles (20 minutes total):**

Each person takes a turn in each role (mentor, mentee, observer)
Use 6 minutes per scenario, 2 minutes per role rotation

**Scenario 1:** Your mentee has great ideas but consistently undersells them, using qualifiers like "this might be dumb, but..." and "I'm not sure if this is right..." Provide adjusting feedback.

**Scenario 2:** Your mentee successfully navigated a difficult conflict by staying curious and asking questions rather than getting defensive. Provide reinforcing feedback.

**Scenario 3:** Your mentee talks about "not having time" for important career development activities but describes spending hours on low-value tasks. Provide adjusting feedback.

**Process:**
- Mentor: Deliver feedback using the models above
- Mentee: Respond naturally, share how it landed
- Observer: Take notes, provide feedback to mentor

**Rotation:** After each scenario, everyone moves one role

**Group Debrief (10 minutes):**
- What made feedback effective or ineffective?
- What was hardest about giving adjusting feedback?
- How did permission-based framing change the dynamic?
- What will you do differently in real mentoring conversations?

<h2 id="05"><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microsoft/sqlworkshops/master/graphics/pencil2.png">2.5 Facilitating Reflection and Insight</h2>

One of the mentor's most valuable contributions is creating space for mentees to pause, reflect, and discover insights they couldn't access in the busy flow of work. This is where lasting learning happens.

<h3>Why Reflection Matters</h3>

Research shows that learning comes not from experience itself, but from reflection on experience. The Kolb Learning Cycle illustrates this:

1. **Concrete Experience** (doing something)
2. **Reflective Observation** (thinking about what happened)
3. **Abstract Conceptualization** (drawing conclusions and principles)
4. **Active Experimentation** (trying new approaches based on learning)

Most professionals are great at steps 1 and 4 but skip steps 2 and 3. Mentors facilitate 2 and 3.

> Studies by Giada Di Stefano and colleagues at Harvard found that employees who spent 15 minutes reflecting on their work at the end of each day performed 23% better than those who didn't.

<h3>Creating Reflective Space</h3>

**Slow Down:**
- Resist rushing to action
- Use silence to let thinking develop
- Ask: "What do you need to sit with for a moment?"

**Shift Perspective:**
- "If you were advising your best friend in this situation, what would you say?"
- "What would you see differently from your manager's view?"
- "10 years from now, how might you see this?"

**Notice Patterns:**
- "This is the third time you've mentioned X. What do you make of that?"
- "I'm hearing a theme of Y across these stories. Do you notice that?"
- Help mentees connect dots across experiences

**Connect to Values:**
- "When you talk about this, what values are at play for you?"
- "What matters most to you about this decision?"
- "Where do you feel most aligned with who you want to be?"

<h3>Powerful Reflection Questions</h3>

**Learning from Experience:**
- "What are you learning about yourself through this?"
- "What surprised you?"
- "What would you do differently next time?"
- "What assumptions were challenged?"

**Uncovering Patterns:**
- "When else have you felt this way?"
- "What's familiar about this situation?"
- "What patterns do you notice in how you respond?"

**Generating Insight:**
- "What's becoming clearer as we talk?"
- "What do you know now that you didn't before?"
- "What's the real issue underneath the surface issue?"

**Connecting to Purpose:**
- "How does this connect to your larger goals?"
- "What does this situation teach you about what you want?"
- "Where is this taking you?"

<h3>Reflective Practices to Teach Mentees</h3>

Help mentees develop their own reflection muscles:

**After-Action Reviews:**
- After important events: "What was supposed to happen? What actually happened? Why the difference? What will I do next time?"

**Weekly Reflection Ritual:**
- End of week: "What worked well? What didn't? What am I learning? What will I do differently?"

**Journaling Prompts:**
- "What am I grateful for?"
- "What challenged me today?"
- "What am I becoming aware of?"

**Decision Journal:**
- Before major decisions, write down: current thinking, assumptions, expected outcomes
- Review later to spot patterns in decision-making

<h3>Moving from Reflection to Insight to Action</h3>

The progression:

1. **Observe** what happened (facts, data)
2. **Reflect** on meaning and patterns
3. **Derive insight** about self, situation, or principles
4. **Commit to action** based on learning
5. **Test** new approaches
6. **Reflect** on results

As mentor, you facilitate this cycle, not by pushing through it quickly, but by honoring each step.

<h3>When Insight Emerges</h3>

You'll know real insight is happening when:
- Mentee's energy shifts (excitement, surprise, relief)
- "Aha!" moments arrive spontaneously
- They say "I never thought about it that way"
- Silence is followed by breakthrough
- They discover the answer themselves

When this happens:
- Pause and honor it
- "That seems significant - say more about that insight"
- Help them articulate and cement it
- Connect it to action: "Given that realization, what changes?"
