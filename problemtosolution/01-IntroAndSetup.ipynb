To begin, you need to understand three general areas:\n\n- The problem\n- The options (and components) for solving the problem\n- The constraints and variables for the solution/problem instersection\n\nWhat you're often thinking of is a single problem with many possible components within a solution. Or, the constraints and variables may dictate that you start from the other end - the components - to be either included or excluded from the solution. Once you know the possible options for a solution, you also need to know the details of how the component will be used in the solution. \n\nClearly a database can help with defining and setting up these intersections of problem, solution and components. And in particular, a Graph Database, with it's focus on relationships between objects, is ideally suited for the task. SQL Server inlcudes a Graph Database feature to allow you to create and query Graph objects. This presentation will help you understand how to do that.",

The main concepts are: \r\n\r\n- A graph database is a collection of **Nodes** (or *vertices*) and **Edges** (or *relationships*)\r\n- A **Node** represents an *entity* (for example, a *person* or an *organization*)\r\n- An **Edge** represents a *relationship* between the two nodes that it connects (for example, *likes* or *friends*)\r\n\r\nYou'll define Nodes and then connect them with Edges. The relationships between them are two-way, and you can then query them answering questions like:\r\n\r\n- Which **Restaurants** does this **City** have?\r\n- Which **People** live in this **City**?\r\n- Which **People** have which *Friends*?\r\n- Which **Restaurant** does this **Person** like? \r\n\r\n<p><img style=\"float: left; margin: 0px 35px 35px 0px;\" src=\"https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/graphs/media/person-cities-restaurants-tables.png?view=sql-server-2017\"> </p>\r\n\r\nThe **For Further Study** section below has more resources to learn about Graph Databases.",

We'll only show one, and you can repeat the process for more of the Services you want to include [from this location](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/). \r\n\r\nTo learn how this works, we'll start with a solution we already know about. One problem a company might have is that they would like to ensure a subset of their data is available externally for customers to use. One possible solution is to use SQL Server Replication from an on-premises SQL Server to a Virtual Machine running in Microsoft Azure.

At the very least we'd like to have the official documentation. We might also want tutorials, books, videos, workshops, classes and more. We can do that by setting up another Node - and since it will support lots of references to and from almost everything we will create, we're able to enter a single reference (perhaps a comprehensive workshop) that will be used by more than one Node. \r\n\r\nFor now, let's just set up the official documentation for the Azure Virtual Machines. There are at least two types of those, Windows and Linux, and both might be used in our solution, so let's set up the References Node and then enter the official documentation into it:  \r\n\r\n- Edit the following code cell for any changes you wish, and then run it:\r\n",
