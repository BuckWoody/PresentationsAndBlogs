The Data Literacy workshop is taught using the following components, which you will need for the sections that follow. For this workshop, you will use a computer, Microsoft Excel, and other components you can download from the Internet. You'll get references to other web resources, so you'll need a good Internet connection for the course. 

While this course can be self-taught, it's most often completed [with the instructor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/buckwoody/). 

Even with a high school education on numerics, reading, writing and so on, it may have been a while since you have had to use those skills. Here’s a quick list of refreshers that will assist:

### Reading skills

- [This series will assist you in reading math, science, history and other works.](https://www.khanacademy.org/test-prep/sat/sat-reading-writing-practice/new-sat-reading/v/reading-science-passage). 

### Math

- You'll find resources on this page for [basic numeracy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math) (the ability to add, subtract, multiply and divide, percentages, ratios, geometry, estimating, order of operations, aggregations). Select a track you need to work on and complete that section. 

### Geography

- There are [a set of resources here you can use to learn more about geography](https://alison.com/tag/geography), which you'll  use later for working with coordinate data.

### Time calculations

Aside from being able to calculate time, month, day and year differences, you should also be familiar with using time-based data - often called *Time Series* data. You can [learn more about that topic here](https://towardsdatascience.com/almost-everything-you-need-to-know-about-time-series-860241bdc578).

### Graphing

In the topics that follow, you'll learn about creating graphs. You need to understand the different types of charts in data, which you will cover in the class assignments. You will need a background in line and slope in many cases, and [you can learn more about that here](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/algebra-basics/alg-basics-graphing-lines-and-slope).



In addition to the topics above, it’s important to understand basic statistics. This branch of mathematics deals with data specifically, and on analyzing it. This is the one subject I find lacking in most adults who are asked to analyze data, and the place you should spend a lot of time. [There’s an excellent, free set of courses here, although there are many others](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/statistics-probability). Find one that works for you, and spend time with it until you have the basic concepts down.
