# Linux System Setup

These are a few of the scripts, commands, and other environment settings I use on my Linux systems. I'm currently running Ubuntu Dev release, which is working well with these settings. Some of these commands won't run properly unless you are in "sudo" or "su" level, so be aware of that.

This is for info and examples **only**. I explain a few things here, but if *anything* is a new term or command, highlight it and look it up. Understand what your are doing if you want to try this - and you're on your own here - test first, don't run this in production first! 

### Disclaimer, for people who need to be told this sort of thing: 

*Never trust any script, presentation, code or information including those that you find here, until you understand exactly what it does and how it will act on your systems. Always check scripts and code on a test system or Virtual Machine, not a production system. Yes, there are always multiple ways to do things, and this script, code, information, or content may not work in every situation, for everything. Itâ€™s just an example, people. All scripts on this site are performed by a professional stunt driver on a closed course. Your mileage may vary. Void where prohibited. Offer good for a limited time only. Keep out of reach of small children. Do not operate heavy machinery while using this script. If you experience blurry vision, indigestion or diarrhea during the operation of this script, see a physician immediately*

If you want to suggest something here, add an [Issue](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) referencing this page and what you want to mention. If I like it, I'll put it here. I'll not close the Issue unless it's a bug you've found, that way you can see what other people do that I didn't include. 

# Install localpurge

sudo apt-get install localepurge

# Update Ubuntu
As I mentioned, I run a complete update script to keep my system up to date and secure. I also do things like making sure the time is sync'd first (super important), find out the drive space, do some cleanup, and show my network status. 

> This is the most dangerouse of the scripts, don't run this on your test system without understanding everything it does. Completely. You are on your own here.
