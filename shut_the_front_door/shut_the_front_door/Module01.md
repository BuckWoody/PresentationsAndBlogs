In this module of the workshop you'll cover the main avenues attackers use to compromise a user's system.

In each module you'll get more references, which you should follow up on to learn more. Also watch for links within the text - click on each one to explore that topic.

You'll cover these topics in the workshop:

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png">1.1 User Error</h2>

<p>Studies show that Cybercrime has <a href="https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/" target="_blank">increased by over 600%</a> since 2019. More security vectors, less updates, weak passwords, falling prey to phishing (clicking links and opening files), downloading bad software, and sharing sharing suspicious links are all causes of increased attack surfaces on the users. Most users are not technically savvy enough to recognize when they are being attacked. No matter how much you secure a system, users clicking a spurious link can allow an attacker into the computer, so the first line of defense for your environment is to brief the user so that they understand how attackers work, and what they can do to prevent attacks.</p>

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Internet Scamming - Awareness and Education</b></p>

<p>In this activity you will view a video on the process scammers follow to attack a victim. You can use the information in the videos to create a briefing for your users.</p>

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png">1.2 Vunerable Systems</h2>

All systems connected to a network can be a target for an attack. Many systems come with default configurations, alarmingly this is true for important systems like routers, thermostats, and more.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Finding Defualt Passwords.</b></p>
You will identify a few key internet connected devices in every home and business and do some security research for each.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Description</b></p>

Take an inventory of your router and any other netwrok connected devices that such as cameras, fire alarms, door locks, medical sensors and more. 

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Identify brand and model used where you are. Search for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_password">default password</a> on that device <a href="https://cirt.net/passwords"></a>Cirt.Net default passwords. If the website doesnt have the brand, use a search engine to find the default credentials.</p>

<p style="border-bottom: 1px solid lightgrey;"></p>

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png">1.3 Loss of Credentials</h2>

  One of the other, least preventable vulnerabilities is when a company or device at a business has been comprimised. When a company is hacked one of the prime targets is the personal information of the customers. Card skimmers on devices that accept credit cards is another way. 

  <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Have you been Pwned?</b></p>

  You will be using a website that catalogues the credentials lost in large data breaches and posted on dark web boards for others to use. 

  <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Description</b></p>

  Go to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">Have I been Pwned?</a> and type in your emails addresses. This website will tell you if your credentials have been leaked and where they were leaked from.

  <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

  <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Go to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">Have I been Pwned?</a></p>
  <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Identify any email addresses you would like to check and enter them into the field. </p>
  <p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Look at the results - if your credentials have been comprimised we recommend you change the password for the company that the data was leaked from, and if the password and email combination is used in multiple places, you should change those as well (Unique passwords are important in preventing this!).</p>
