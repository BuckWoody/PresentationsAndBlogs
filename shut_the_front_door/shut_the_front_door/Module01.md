In this module of the workshop you'll cover the main avenues attackers use to compromise a user's system.

In each module you'll get more references, which you should follow up on to learn more. Also watch for links within the text - click on each one to explore that topic.

You'll cover these topics in the workshop:

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png">1.1 User Error</h2>

<p>Studies show that Cybercrime has <a href="https://purplesec.us/resources/cyber-security-statistics/" target="_blank">increased by over 600%</a> since 2019. More security vectors, users not applying updates, weak passwords, falling prey to phishing (clicking links and opening files), downloading bad software, and sharing sharing suspicious links are all causes of increased attack surfaces on the user's systems. Most users are not technically savvy enough to recognize when they are being attacked. No matter how much you secure a system, users clicking a spurious link can allow an attacker into the computer, so the first line of defense for your environment is to brief the user so that they understand how attackers work, and what they can do to prevent attacks.</p>

<p>In this activity you will view a video on the process scammers follow to attack a victim. You can use the information in the videos to create a briefing for your users.</p>

<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png">1.2 Vulnerable Systems</h2>

All systems connected to a network can be a target for an attack. Many systems come with default configurations, and many of those are not set for the highest level of security. Your next step is to evaluate these configurations along with the users. One of the most common configuration settings that should be changed on a new system or software installation is to ensure any default passwords are changed to one that meets a high level of complexity.

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Finding Default Passwords.</b></p>
You will identify a few key internet connected devices in every home and business and do some security research for each.

<br>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Description</b></p>

Take an inventory of your router and any other netwrok connected devices that such as cameras, fire alarms, door locks, medical sensors and other devices. 

<br>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

<br>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Identify the brand and model used for each device that has a password. Search for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Default_password">default password</a> on that device using <a href="https://cirt.net/passwords">Cirt.Net</a> default passwords. If the website doesnt have the brand, use a search engine to find the default credentials.</p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Change the password to a more complex passphase <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/create-and-use-strong-passwords-c5cebb49-8c53-4f5e-2bc4-fe357ca048eb">using the tips you find here</a>. If your organization allows it, you can also <a href="https://cybernews.com/password-generator/">use a password generator</a> and storage tool <a href="https://nordpass.com/">such as NordPass</a>. An even stronger solution is to use a <a href="https://pixelprivacy.com/resources/two-factor-authentication/">Two-Factor Authentication system </a> wherever possible.</p>

<br>
<h2><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/pencil2.png">1.3 Loss of Credentials</h2>

<p>Another common vulnerability is when a company or device at a business has been comprimised. When a company is hacked one of the prime targets is the personal information of the customers and internal users. These credentials are then used to perform illegal activities or compromise other systems.</p>

<p>Companies and organizations can help prevent these lossses, but should also notify all affected users and customers that the breach occurred, along with specific steps they can take to secure their own systems. <a href="https://us-cert.cisa.gov/incident-notification-guidelines">Your organization should develop and explain a formal incident response to alert users to the issue and give them a checklist to follow to secure their system</a>.</p>  

<br>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/point1.png"><b>Activity: Have you been Pwned?</b></p>
You will use a website that catalogues the credentials lost in large data breaches and posted on dark web boards for others to use. 
<br>

<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Description</b></p>
<br>

<p>Go to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">Have I been Pwned?</a> and type in your e-mail addresses. This website will tell you if your credentials have been compromised and where they were leaked from.</p>

>NOTE: This tool does not have your password, nor will it ask for one. It checks a database of known breaches for your e-mail account.

<br>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkmark.png"><b>Steps</b></p>

<br>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Go to <a href="https://haveibeenpwned.com/" target="_blank">Have I been Pwned?</a></p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Identify any email addresses you would like to check and enter them into the tool.</p>
<p><img style="float: left; margin: 0px 15px 15px 0px;" src="../graphics/checkbox.png">  Look at the results - if your credentials have been comprimised, change the password for that location. If the password and email combination is used in multiple places, you should change those as well. Unique passwords are important in preventing this issue.</p>
